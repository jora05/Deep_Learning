# Deep_Learning 
This repository contains materials for Assignment 1.

## Repository Contents
This repository contains the following files:
- DL_Backpropagation_pen_and_paper.ipynb, this notebook contains the solutions for Question 1 (Backpropagation pen and paper)
- DL_AutoDiff_Nanograd.ipynb, this contains the solutions for Question 2 (AutoDiff framework)
- feedforwardAssignment.ipynb, the notebook contains the solutions for Question 3 and 4. 

## Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.12
Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab

### Required Libraries

The project uses the following Python libraries. You need to have them installed to run any of the files:

- networkx
- matplotlib
- numpy
- torch
- pandas
- seaborn
- IPython
- wandb

Built-in libraries (random, typing, math, copy) are also used in the solutions, however they are included with Python and do not require installation.
Most libraries can be installed via pip. For example:
```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib numpy torch pandas seaborn ipython wandb
